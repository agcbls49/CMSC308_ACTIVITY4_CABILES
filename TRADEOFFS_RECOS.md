# Trade-offs and Recommendations

| Scenario | Static Typing | Dynamic Typing/Javascript |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Safety | Errors are caught before runtime | Errors are only found during code execution |
| Flexibility | Less flexible because of strict typing rules | More flexible which allows quick prototyping |
| Performance | Compile time is optimized which makes it faster | Type checking is done during runtime so its slower |
| Developer Experience | Better for large teams and companies | Good for beginners and quick scripting or prototyping |

# Language Recommendations
| Scenario | Recommendation | Programming Language |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Rapid Protoyping Web Development | Dynamic and Weak Typing | Javascript |
| Data Science and Scripting | Dynamic and Strong Typing | Python |
| Large and Complex Projects | Static and Strong Typing | TypeScript, Java, C# |
| Performance Critical Systems | Static and Strong Typing | C, C++ and Rust |
